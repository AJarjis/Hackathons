# Hackathons
A list of hackathons I have attended.

| Hackathon | Role | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sync the City 2018 | Developer | Norwichâ€™s 54 Hour Startup event in which my talented team were challenged to pitch a startup idea and make it a reality. The result of this 54 hour chaos was [ShareSpace](www.sharespace.netlify.com), a peer-to-peer storage platform, which came second in the competition. More details about the event found here: https://syncthecity.com/ |
| Hack The City 2017 | Developer | An overnight (24 hour) hackathon in which my team worked on the LazyInvest project, which is available on my GitHub. More information about the event here: http://www.hackcity.org/ |
